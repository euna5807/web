My life's been magic seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
It’s funny when you want it Suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold’s just plastic
Every day every night
I’ve been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night
I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me I’m never coming down
I worked my whole life Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground On the ground
Everything I need is on the ground
Nah but they don’t hear me though (Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don’t hear me though (You’re running out of time)
My world’s been hectic seems electric
But I’ve been waking up with your voice in my head
And I’m trying to send a message
And let you know that every single minute I’m without you I regret it
Every day every night I’ve been thinking back on you and I
Every day every night I worked my whole life
Just to get right just to be like
Look at me I’m never coming down
I worked my whole life Just to get high just to realize
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground
On the ground Everything I need is on the ground
Nah but they don’t hear me though (Yeah what goes up it must come down)
Nah but they don’t hear me though (You’re running out of time)
I’m way up in the clouds ...
